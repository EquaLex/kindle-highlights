For Aboriginal people in Australia, the whole of human and pre-human history is contained in the notion of the Dreaming. The Dreaming was a period of time, infinitely far back in the past, when ancestors moved across the landscape creating the shape of that landscape and giving it cosmological significance.

National and personal identities were problematical, and also those of race and class as we shall see, but there were deeper issues of identity that came to the surface through 19th-century debates which have never gone away.

Crucially, however, we do not see communities of practice as being neatly divided into cultures. Rather they are more like a Venn diagram, with a series of overlapping ways of acting, some shared with neighbours and others not. For example, from southeast England in the middle Bronze Age (c.1500 bc) are found fields in a number of areas with similar layouts, but across their distribution are different forms of pottery and metalwork.

As one moves away from both these valleys bronzework changes, indicating they were important corridors of communication. Houses in England are round, those in France rectangular. There was clearly movement of people, artefacts, and ideas in the Bronze Age, but also people were creating their own local ways of life, by taking some elements from the broader cultural milieu and developing others for themselves.

Not far from northern Australia, on Flores in the Indonesian island chain, come fossils from the diminutive Homo floresiensis, which might date back some 200,000 years until around 22 kya. Now known to the world as the ‘hobbit’, these creatures are puzzling because of their small stature and brains, although they did use stone tools.
